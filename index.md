### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Both parts of Lab 6 were my favorite because it had introduced argument sizes at which I thought was pretty cool. Upon creating codes for sandwich making, I really liked how neat it was that you would have to consider the first object of the sandwich to be the second argument in place of running the code. Along with sandwich making, BlackJack was the first challenging code for my group and I and it was awesome when we got it running perfectly.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was obviously the most nostalgic and easiest lab of the semester. As a Mechanical Engineer, I would say that coding was really my weak spot, but upon reading the first ReadMe and following the instructions, it made me hopeful for the rest of the semester. Getting the code to run via using a new software that I was not used too was pretty amazing.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 2 was another memorable one, because it created a unique pattern that printed out when the code was ran. This to me was more memorable than the other codes is that it printed out something that usually is not related to any kind of answer we would seek for, it is just a pattern. This pattern code would then set us up to more incoming uses of matrixes and vectors for future labs.
